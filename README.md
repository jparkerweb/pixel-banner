## üîß Installation

1. Open Obsidian and go to Settings
2. Navigate to Community Plugins and disable Safe Mode
3. Click on Browse and search for "Pixel Banner"
4. Install the plugin and enable it

## üöÄ Basic Workflow

1. Open a note and click the `Banner Flag` in the top left corner of your Note  

    ![1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jparkerweb/pixel-banner/refs/heads/main/img/1.jpg)

2. Select a `Source` for your Banner (the AI and Collection options require you to first create a FREE Pixel Banner Plus account at: https://pixel-banner.online)  

    ![2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jparkerweb/pixel-banner/refs/heads/main/img/2.jpg)

3. _Optionally_ Add an `Icon Image` (choose from your vault, the web, or our online free collection)

    ![3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jparkerweb/pixel-banner/refs/heads/main/img/3.jpg)

4. _Optionally_ Add `Icon Emoji & Text` (this can be any text, but it is advised to use an Emoji ü§£)

    ![4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jparkerweb/pixel-banner/refs/heads/main/img/4.jpg)

5. _Optionally_ adjust the `position`, `size`, `color`, and other `properties` for the `Banner Image` and `Banner Icon` of the note (by default they will inherit the General settings in Pixel Banner's main setting page, but are customizable per note)

    ![5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jparkerweb/pixel-banner/refs/heads/main/img/5.jpg)

6. Click the `Banner Flag` icon anytime to adjust any of these settings (the GUI is the most user-friendly way to adjust a note's pixel banner settings though you can also access and modify them through the `properties` of the note)

    ![6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jparkerweb/pixel-banner/refs/heads/main/img/6.jpg)

## üóÇÔ∏è Using External Images (file:// Protocol)

You can now reference images stored outside your vault using the `file:///` protocol. This is useful for:
- Sharing banner images across multiple vaults
- Using images from a central image library
- Referencing system-wide image collections

### Usage Examples (frontmatter):
- **Windows**: `banner: file:///C:\Images\banner.jpg` or `banner: file:///C:\Users\username\Pictures\banner.png`
- **macOS**: `banner: file:///Users/username/Pictures/banner.jpg` or `banner: file:///Applications/MyApp/images/banner.png`
- **Linux**: `banner: file:///home/username/Pictures/banner.jpg` or `banner: file:///opt/images/banner.png`

**Note**: The image file must exist at the specified path and be accessible to Obsidian.

## üìù Manual Banner Configuration (Frontmatter)

You can manually configure banners by editing the frontmatter (properties) of your notes. Pixel Banner supports multiple formats for maximum flexibility:

### Supported Banner Formats

#### Wiki Link Formats
```yaml
banner: [[folder/subfolder/image.jpg]]
banner: [[subfolder/image.jpg]]
banner: [[image.jpg]]
banner: "[[folder/subfolder/image.jpg]]"
banner: "[[subfolder/image.jpg]]"
banner: "[[image.jpg]]"
banner: "![[folder/subfolder/image.jpg]]"
banner: "![[subfolder/image.jpg]]"
banner: "![[image.jpg]]"
```

#### Markdown Image Formats
```yaml
banner: "![](folder/subfolder/image.jpg)"
banner: "![](subfolder/image.jpg)"
banner: "![](image.jpg)"
```

#### Plain Path Formats
```yaml
banner: folder/subfolder/image.jpg
banner: subfolder/image.jpg
banner: image.jpg
banner: "folder/subfolder/image.jpg"
banner: "subfolder/image.jpg"
banner: "image.jpg"
```

#### URL Formats
```yaml
banner: https://example.com/image.jpg
banner: "https://example.com/image.jpg"
```

#### Keyword Formats (API Search)
```yaml
banner: sunset beach
banner: "sunset beach"
banner: nature, landscape, mountains
```

### Important Notes

- **Partial Path Resolution**: Paths like `image.jpg` or `subfolder/image.jpg` are resolved relative to your note's location
- **YAML Limitation**: Unquoted values starting with `!` (like `banner: ![[image.jpg]]`) don't work due to YAML parsing rules. Always quote them: `banner: "![[image.jpg]]"`
- **Video Support**: All formats work with video files (.mp4, .mov) as well as images

### üéØ Image Property Format Setting

Pixel Banner allows you to choose how banner image paths are saved in your frontmatter when using the GUI. This setting is especially useful for compatibility with other plugins like Make.md (or any other plugin that prefers the plain path format).

To configure this:
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Pixel Banner ‚Üí General** tab
2. Find the **Image Property Format** dropdown
3. Choose your preferred format:
   - `image` - Plain path format (e.g., `banner: image.jpg`) - **Compatible with Make.md and other plugins that prefer the plain path format**
   - `[[image]]` - Wiki link format (e.g., `banner: [[image.jpg]]`)
   - `![[image]]` - Embedded wiki link format (e.g., `banner: ![[image.jpg]]`)

**Note**: The plugin can **read** all three formats regardless of this setting. This setting only affects how new banner paths are **saved** to frontmatter when inserted through the GUI.

## üé¨ Working with Video Banners

### Adding Video Banners
1. **From Your Vault**: Select video files (.mp4, .mov) from your vault just like images
2. **From Collection**: Browse video banners in the Pixel Banner Plus Collection (marked with video badges)
3. **Download & Save**: Videos are automatically saved with correct file extensions and you can choose the save location

### Video Banner Features
- **Smart Badges**: Video banners display with "VIDEO" badges for easy identification
- **Seamless Experience**: All existing banner features work with videos (icons, positioning, etc.)
- **Flexible Saving**: Choose where to save downloaded videos and customize filenames
